Intent:
	Provide a way to support a large number of fine-grained objects efficiently

When to use:
	Large number of objects
	High storage costs
	Extrinsic state (shareable)
	Many objects -> replaced by few objects
	Object identity isn't necessary

Benefits:
	Reduce the number of instances
	Share intrinsic state per object

Drawback:
	Factory needs to manage shared instances -> run-time overhead

The flyweight can be used along with composite pattern. The leaf nodes in the composite pattern 
are the flyweight


Conclusion:
	Improve performance
	Manage objects more efficiently
