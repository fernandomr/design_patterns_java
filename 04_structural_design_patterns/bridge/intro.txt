Intent:
	Decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.
	Known as: Handle, Body

When to use:
	When we want to loosely couple an interface and its implementation;
	When there could be subclasses for abstraction and implementation;
	If you need to change the implementation at runtime without affecting clients.;

Benefits:
	Decouple interface and implementation;
	Improve extensibility;
	Hide implementation details;
	Reduce number of subclasses

Drawback:
	--

The bridge:
