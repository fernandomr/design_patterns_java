Intent:
	Convert the interface of a class into another interface the client expects.
	An adapter lets classes work together that otherwise couldn't work because of incompatible interfaces.

When to use:
	When we want to re-use an existing class;
	Combine unrelated classes with an incompatible interface;

The adapter forwards the request to an adaptee;
	- Can be through the adapter itself (inheritance);
	- Can be through a reference of the adaptee;


Benefits:
	Adapter can override adaptee behaviour -> it is a subclass;
	One adapter can work with many adaptees;
	

Drawback:
	Adapter won't work for a class with many subclasses (can't extend them all);
	Sometimes is harder to override the adaptee behaviour.

The adapter:
	Can connect legacy systems;
	Can adapt one interface to another;
