Intent:
	Provide an unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem.
	Façade defines a higher level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.

When to use:
	Decouple clients from subsystems;
	Provide a simple interface;
	Subsystem layering (business, data and client services) and each of the layers provides a façade to the other layer.

The Façade is a subsystem access point.
It knows how the subsystem works.
It delegates the functionalities to the subsystem because the functionalities are only implemented in the subsystem.

Façade needs to translate a request into subsystem specific objects.

Benefits:
	Clients don't have to access the subsystem.
	Loose coupling.
	Subsystem still can be used directly (if necessary).

Drawback:
	Façade introduces an extra programming layer.
