Intent:
	Decouple a sender and a receiver;
	Avoid coupling the sender of a request by giving more than one object a change to handle the request.
	Chain the receiving object and pass the request along the chain until an object handles it.

When to use:
	When multiple objects need to handle a request;
	When isn't clear upfront who will handle it;
	Who can handle the request should be dynamic (add or remove handlers dynamically);

Benefits:
	Loose coupling between requester and receiver;
	Objects can spread responsibility in handling requests;

Drawbacks:
	No guarantee the request will be handled;

Conclusion:
	Handle requests dynamically;
	Enhanced loose coupling between sender and receiver;
	Objects that handle the request can be added or removed dynamically;
