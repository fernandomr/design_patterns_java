Intent:
	Encapsulate a request as an object, letting you parameterize clients with different requests,
		queue or log requests and support undoable operations.
	Known as: Action, Transaction

When to use:
	When command can be a parameter
	Pass a command like a general object
	When there's a need to queue requests
	To save request state
	To undo functionality
	To support logging
	To re-execute code in case of failure

Benefits:
	Decouples:
		Object that invokes the operation from object that knows how to perform it
	Commands ARE Objects:
		All OO rules apply to them
	Create new commands is easy: just add a new class

Conclusion:
	Good to capture a request
	Good to centralize action functionality
