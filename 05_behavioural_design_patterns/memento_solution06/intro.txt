Intent:
	Externalize an object internal state
	Capture and externalize an object's internal state without violating encapsulation, so that the object can be restored to this state later. 

When to use:
	To save a snapshot of an object's state;
	When a direct interface to object state would violate encapsulation;
	

Benefits:
	Preserve encapsulation;
	Simplifies the originator (the object that has the state)

Drawbacks:
	Might be expensive to run due to object creation;
	The language must facilitate that only the originator can access the memento state;
	Extra management for caretaking the memento should be created;
	

Conclusion:
	Access state but preserve encapsulation;
	Save snapshot of object.


Why can't the Command pattern be used?
	Because there is times where save the object state is required.
