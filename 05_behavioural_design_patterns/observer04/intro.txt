Intent:
	Used to subscribe to changes in object states
	Define one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically

When to use:
	When a change to an object should trigger a change in others
	When there's no idea on how many objects need to be changed
	When objects should/can be notified when other object changes
	One object may notify another without knowing them directly

Benefits:
	Loose coupling between observer and subject
	Support broadcast model

Drawbacks:
	One change can result in many unnecessary notifications
	Clients don't know what effects in object state changes will happen

Conclusion:
	Observes changes in objects
	Preserve loose coupling
