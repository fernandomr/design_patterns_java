Intent:
	Define the skeleton of an algorithm in a operation, deferring some steps to subclasses.
	The Template pattern lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm structure.
	Ex: a document always will have the same lifecyle: save, open, close, read.

When to use:
	Implement an algorithm once:
		Subclasses can provide different implementation.
	Avoid code duplication.
	Define how a class should be extended:
		By implementing hooks.

Benefits:
	Ultimate code re-use: important for class libraries.
	Provide hooks.
	The abstract base class generally doesn't implement a hook: forces client to have an implementation.

Conclusion:
	Allows to heavily re-use code.
	Allows to provide hooks.
