Prototype method:
	It creates objects based on other objects, which are called prototypes.


Intent:
	Specify the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance and create new objects by copying this prototype.


When to use:
	Classes that need to be instantiated are specific at run time.
	When there's a need to  avoid building class hierarchies.
	A class can have multiple instances of state.


Benefits:
	Add/remove prototypes at runtime.
	Reduce sub classing.
	Configure application dynamically
	Different values for new objects: when dynamically changing the prototype it can also change the state of its properties.

Drawbacks:
	Requires to create prototypes before other object creation.
