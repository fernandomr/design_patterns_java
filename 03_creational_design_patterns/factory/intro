Factory method:
	Great for delegating object creation at runtime
	
Designed to let developers easily create new documents
Designed to create a framework so a new applications could have their own document type
Re-use code

Intent:
	Define an interface for creating an object but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate
	Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.
	Known as virtual constructor.

When to use:
	A class can't expect the type of object it must create.
	Subclasses must decide what types of objects are created.

Benefits:
	Delegates object creation to runtime. We don't need to know in advance what type of object will be created.
	Hooks for subclasses to extend the framework.
	The Base Class can provide a default implementation.
